# Project_Roshambo

This is Project Roshambo. Essentially, this is my foolish, foolish, foolish attempt at creating a game of Rock Paper Scissors. It does. not. work. in. the. webpage. It works in the console. You'll have to open up the Google DevTools to play it. If you don't know how to do that, look it up. Anyway, have fun playing my shitty game.
